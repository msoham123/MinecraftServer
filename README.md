# Soham's Minecraft Server

While the actually repository is used to save world data and settings, this README.md serves as a tool for me to document and explain how my Minecraft Server works.

## Section One - What is a Minecraft Server?

A Minecraft server is a player-owned or business-owned multiplayer game server for the 2009 Mojang video game Minecraft. These servers allow players of the game to play together without having to use a LAN to connect. 

## Section Two - Java and Paper

Minecraft is a Java program that can be run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The server software is no exception to this and you need Java to run it. Mojang provides a minecraft server JAR that you can use to run your server. However, there are a myriad of community forks of this JAR, and I am using one called Paper. Paper is a high performance fork of the Spigot Minecraft Server that aims to fix gameplay and mechanics inconsistencies as well as to improve performance. I am using Paper as opposed to other alternatives because my server machine is not an enterprise level server: it is a low spec old laptop. 

## Section Three - Hardware
